I also love<br /> solving problems and making cool<br /> features, experimenting things and<br /> trying to figure out why my console<br /> is yelling at me.",

    "experiences": "After graduating as a graphic designer I launched Hemphill, a paper magazine about art and old school culture. Only 1 issue was published in 2017. I did some freelance graphic design before I started learning frontend development. After a first experience as a React developer at Troopers Agency in Nantes, I went back to freelance, but this time in development.",
    "development": "I'm a huge fan of JAMStack, I usually use React and Gatsby with Prismic as headless CMS. I test a lot of things, like TypeScript, CI/CD, tests, which I use for my Butter Slider library. Otherwise, I'm comfortable with terminal, git, scss, npm, node, canvas2d, Gsap, animeJs...",
    "design": "I don't do print design anymore, but I still do webdesign for custom projects. Design is super important to me, I love the emotions that it can create when all the layout, typos and colors match to make something unique and singular. I spend far too much time on Pinterest, Dribble and Instagram scrolling through designer accounts for inspiration. However, I love clean black and white designs as much as I love sites that come out of the space, FULL OF COLORS, AND GO IN ALL DIRECTIONS."
